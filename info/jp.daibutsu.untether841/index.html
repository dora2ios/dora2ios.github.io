                <p><b>Note1</b>: This package and jailbreak was created to learn and demonstrate the old jailbreak style that was used about 6 years ago. All of these are provided for educational and learning purposes, and the author and provider assume no responsibility for them. Abusing these is never acceptable, so never do it!</p>
                <p>We strongly recommend that you update your device's iOS to the latest version to improve the security of your device.</p>

                <p><b>Note2</b>: Upgrading this package will require a reboot. Since iOS 8, if you upgrade Cydia at the same time as installing a package that asks for a reboot, Cydia might get killed, and you might fail to be asked to perform the reboot. We recommend upgrading manually if this happens.</p>
