                <p>This package is the AFC2 package provided for devices jailbroken with daibutsu 8.4.1 jailbreak.</p>

                <p>AFC stands for "Apple File Conduit" (or at least so says TheiPhoneWiki :/), and is how computer applications such as iTunes and iPhoto can read and write files from your device over USB.
                <p>AFC is "jailed" and only allows access to "media" (such as photos, music, and data for apps from the App Store).</p>
                <p>This package creates a new service, "AFC2", with full filesystem access.</p>
                <p>If you use a USB device management tool, it might need AFC2 to fully work.</p>
                <p><b>However, please understand that AFC2 is considered by many to be a security hole: you might not want to provide full USB filesystem access.</b></p>
                <p>This description is based on the following: <a href="https://cydia.saurik.com/info/com.saurik.afc2d/">AFC2 Â· Cydia</a></p>

                <p>If you install this package, it will always be loaded and enabled when the device runs untether and the jailbreak is applied, unlike the Apple File Conduit "2" provided by saurik.</p>
                <p>This indicates that this package is not dependent on Mobile Substrate, but it is up to you to decide which package to use. Even if you are using daibutsu jailbreak, you can always choose Apple File Conduit "2" instead of daibutsu AFC2.</p>

                <p>v1.1: This version of the package changes the loading format of AFC2 so that executables under /etc/rc.d are executed at the time they are loaded by untether.</p>
